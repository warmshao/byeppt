/// App-wide navigation lockdown for every webContents in the suite.
///
/// Every renderer is a local single-page app loaded exactly once via
/// loadFile/loadURL (which do not emit will-navigate), so a full-page
/// navigation is never part of normal operation — it can only come from
/// hostile document content or AI-generated markup. The guard blocks all of
/// them except same-URL reloads (used by dev tooling), and installs a
/// default-deny window.open handler.
///
/// Apps that intentionally route window.open links to the system browser
/// (docs/slides/pdf via safeExternalUrl) install their own handler on
/// specific webContents after creation; that replaces the default-deny
/// handler for those contents only.
